# NFL Data Source

Python project to fetch latest ESPN data for the NFL 2025 season and normalize the response into CSV files, then combine the CSV files into a single Excel document, which will serve as the source file for my PowerBI project.

See `/docs` for more details.

Usage:

- `uv sync`
- `uv run refresh_espn_data.py`
