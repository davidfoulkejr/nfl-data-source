### 3. **Documentation**

- **`DATA_MODEL_DOCUMENTATION.md`**: Complete data dictionary with schemas, relationships, and usage examples
- **`ERD_DIAGRAM.md`**: Entity Relationship Diagram using Mermaid format

## 🔍 Data Quality Validation

✅ **All Foreign Key Relationships Validated**

- Team references: 100% valid across all tables
- Venue references: 100% valid across all tables
- Player references: 100% valid across all tables
- Position references: 100% valid across all tables

✅ **Data Integrity Confirmed**

- No orphaned records
- All relationships properly maintained
- Normalized structure eliminates data duplication

## 📈 Key Features of the Data Model

### **Star Schema Design**

- Central fact tables connected to dimension tables
- Optimized for analytical queries and reporting
- Supports data warehouse and BI tool integration

### **Proper Normalization**

- Eliminates data duplication
- Maintains referential integrity
- Allows for efficient storage and querying

### **Rich Data Context**

- Complete team information (colors, logos, locations)
- Venue details (indoor/outdoor, location)
- Player statistics and leadership categories
- Broadcasting and scheduling information

## 🎯 Use Cases Enabled

### **Fantasy Football Analytics**

```sql
-- Get top rushing leaders across all games
SELECT p.display_name, pgl.display_value, t.abbreviation
FROM player_game_leaders pgl
JOIN players p ON pgl.player_id = p.player_id
JOIN teams t ON pgl.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE pgl.category_name = 'rushingLeader'
ORDER BY pgl.numeric_value DESC;
```

### **Team Performance Analysis**

```sql
-- Get team records and venues
SELECT t.display_name, tr.record_summary, v.full_name as home_venue
FROM teams t
JOIN team_records tr ON t.team_id = tr.team_id
LEFT JOIN venues v ON t.venue_id = v.venue_id
WHERE tr.record_type = 'total';
```

### **Game Scheduling & Broadcasting**

```sql
-- Get games with broadcast information
SELECT g.event_name, g.event_date, gb.network_names, v.full_name
FROM games g
JOIN competitions c ON g.event_id = c.event_id
JOIN game_broadcasts gb ON g.event_id = gb.event_id
JOIN venues v ON c.venue_id = v.venue_id;
```
